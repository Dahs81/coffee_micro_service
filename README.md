## Coffee Micro Service

This is a simple example of a micro service written in Golang.  I was at a Coffee shop at the time that I wrote this and wanted to create a simple example as both a learning exercise and as an example for others to use.

For the mongo connection, I am using another Go module that I created that is a simple wrapper around a mgo session.  It can be found here: [https://github.com/Dahs81/SimpleSession](https://github.com/Dahs81/SimpleSession)

**This is a work in progress, but everything should be working now.**
